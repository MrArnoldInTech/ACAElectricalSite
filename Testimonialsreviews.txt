“Alan is a top bloke – very professional, great communication and quick to sort out your request. He made himself available to undergo our ewof for our camper, giving up part of his Saturday to do the job. Highly recommend. A+++" Bernie 

“After having a lot of trouble finding someone who could do the work we needed done, we had a fantastic service all-round, right from the first enquiry to completion. Alan was friendly and helpful, and took the time to get the work done during his weekend time. The job done was neat and tidy, and exactly what we asked for. I would definitely recommend Alan’s services for anyone needing an electrical job done and would certainly be using him for any further electrical work we need done." Wiki
